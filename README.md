# ofxManta 

ofxManta is an OpenFrameworks addon for interfacing with the [Manta](http://www.snyderphonics.com/products.htm), a touch-sensitive controller made by [Snyderphonics](http://www.snyderphonics.com/). The Manta has an 8x6 grid of hexagonal touch sensors which sense the amount surface area being covered, in addition to two sliders and four buttons. The library is based on [libmanta](https://github.com/ssfrr/libmanta).

The addon provides a simple interface for the manta with status getters and event callbacks. See included example for details.
